### Welcome!

I am a Graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My research is guided by Professor [BÃ¼lent Yener](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~yener/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Alex Gittens](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/){:target="\_blank"} in the Computer Science department.  

*Research Overview*  
My current focus is on domain adaptation of  neural models for causal information extraction. Due to limited amount of labeled data cause and effect spans in a sentence, it is important to develop models that can generalize to new domains without requiring labeled data for finetuning. My experiments have been focused on unsupervised domain adaptation for extraction of cause and effect spans from text. I am exploring the impact of domain independent linguistic information in improving the performance of adversarial domain adaptation methods. I have also worked on multi-sense embeddings to address the meaning conflation problem in word embeddings that encode different meanings of a word into a single vector. We used contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models to associate the sense embeddings with the approapriate meaning. I have also explored the application of simple word embeddings in semantic search. During my internship at IBM in 2020, I worked on information extraction from structured documents such as scanned images, pdfs etc.

### About me

I graduated from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd){:target="\_blank"} in 2015 with a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I was a Lecturer at [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd){:target="\_blank"} for one semester before joining [Semion Inc.](http://semion.ai){:target="\_blank"} in 2016. In Semion, my work on sentiment analysis using deep learning started my journey in Natural Language Processing.
