### Welcome!

I am a Graduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with expertise in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I have experience training and fine-tuning large language models like BERT and GPT for domain adaptation and information extraction from text and structured documents in low resource settings.
<!-- My research is guided by Professor [BÃ¼lent Yener](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~yener/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Alex Gittens](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/){:target="\_blank"} in the Computer Science department.   -->

*Research Overview*  
My current focus is on domain adaptation of neural models for causal information extraction. I am working on unsupervised domain adaptation for extraction of cause and effect spans from text. I am exploring the idea of integrating domain independent linguistic information in neural models to improve adversarial domain adaptation methods. I have also worked on multi-sense embeddings to address the meaning conflation problem in word embeddings since they encode different meanings of a word into a single vector. We distilled the contextual information from pre-trained language models to train multi-sense embeddings with the appropriate meaning. I have also explored the application of simple word embeddings in semantic search. During my internship at IBM, I worked on information extraction from structured documents such as scanned images, pdfs etc.

<!-- ### About me

I graduated from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](http://www.buet.ac.bd){:target="\_blank"} in 2015 with a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I was a Lecturer at [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd){:target="\_blank"} for one semester before joining [Semion Inc.](http://semion.ai){:target="\_blank"} in 2016. In Semion, my work on sentiment analysis using deep learning started my journey in Natural Language Processing. -->
